h3. Running tests

nimbleShop uses testing framework provided by Ruby on Rails. If you are not familiar with testing philosophy of Rails then you should read "this execellent guide":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html .

In order to run all the tests follow the steps given below

<shell>
git clone git://github.com/nimbleshop/nimbleshop.git
cd nimbleshop
cd nimbleshop_core
rake
</shell>

h3. How to run a single test

If you want to run tests for one single file then execute following command

<shell>
cd nimbleshop_core
bundle exec ruby -I test  test/unit/product_test.rb
</shell>

h3. save_and_open_page

In acceptance test if you need to look at the contents of the page then you can do so by having

<shell>
fill_in 'Price', with: 'wrong price'
click_button 'Submit'
save_and_open_page
</shell>

h3. Installing firefox for selenium tests


nimbleShop uses selenium for acceptance tests. I found that firefox 11 does not play well with selenium. So here are the steps to follow to get selenium tests running on your machine

* If you are using firefox 11 then uninstall it .
* Download (but do not install) firefox 10 from "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7468116/Firefox%2010.0.dmg":http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7468116/Firefox%2010.0.dmg .
* Now turn off internet connection .
* Install firefox 10 .
* Open firefox and go to preferences > Advanced > Update . Check the radio button "Never check for updates". Close preference panel .
* Turn internet on .
* Now run tests for selenium .
