h3. Theme customization

nimbleShop allows you to customize theme. Here is how you can do it.

h4. Fork the theme

Visit "https://github.com/nimbleshop/nimbleshop_simply":https://github.com/nimbleshop/nimbleshop_simply and fork this repository.

h4. Customize the forked version


First clone the nimbleshop repository

<shell>
git clone git://github.com/nimbleshop/nimbleshop_simply.git
cd nimbleshop_simply
git tag -l
</shell>

+git tag -l+ should list the version you are working with. Lets assume that you are working with version +0.0.14+ of nimbleShop.

Next let's checkout the version +0.0.14+ of nimbleshop_simply.

<shell>
git checkout v0.0.14
</shell>

After the above command you will be in +no branch+ . That's ok. Now create a branch called +custom_theme+.

<shell>
git checkout -b custom_theme
</shell>

Now push this branch to github.

<shell>
git push
</shell>

h4. Configuring app to use custom_branch .

Open the +Gemfile+ of your app and change the gem +nimbleshop_simply+ option to have github and branch option.

<shell>
gem 'nimbleshop_simply', github: 'nimbleshop/nimbleshop_simply', branch: :custom_theme
</shell>

h4. Customizing theme

Now open file +~/nimbleshop_simply/app/assets/stylesheets/nimbleshop_simply/custom.css.scss+ . Go to the bottom of the page and add following lines.

<shell>
body {
  background: green;
}
</shell>

h4. Start your rails server

Now start your rails server by running command +rails server+ and visit +http:localhost:3000+ . If you see green background then it means your customization is working .
