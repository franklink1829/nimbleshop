h3. Theme customization

nimbleShop allows you to customize theme. Here is how you can do it.

h4. Get the theme locally

First you need to get the +nimelshop_simply+ theme locally. Look into your +Gemfile.lock+ and search for +nimbleshop+ to find the version of nimbleshop you are working with.Let's assume that you are using +0.0.14+ .

First clone the nimbleshop repository

<shell>
git clone git://github.com/nimbleshop/nimbleshop.git
cd nimbleshop
git tag -l
</shell>

+git tag -l+ should list the version you are working with.

Next let's checkout the version +0.0.14+ .

<shell>
git checkout v0.0.14
</shell>

After the above command you will be in +no branch+ . That's ok.

Now copy this nimbleshop directory to your rails project such that the directories look like this.

<shell>
-rw-r--r--   1 nsingh  staff   916 Dec  5 23:06 Gemfile
-rw-r--r--   1 nsingh  staff  5655 Dec  5 23:06 Gemfile.lock
-rw-r--r--   1 nsingh  staff  9208 Dec  5 23:00 README.rdoc
-rw-r--r--   1 nsingh  staff   271 Dec  5 23:00 Rakefile
drwxr-xr-x   8 nsingh  staff   272 Dec  5 23:00 app
drwxr-xr-x  11 nsingh  staff   374 Dec  5 23:01 config
-rw-r--r--   1 nsingh  staff   156 Dec  5 23:00 config.ru
drwxr-xr-x   7 nsingh  staff   238 Dec  5 23:05 db
drwxr-xr-x   3 nsingh  staff   102 Dec  5 23:00 doc
drwxr-xr-x   4 nsingh  staff   136 Dec  5 23:00 lib
drwxr-xr-x   4 nsingh  staff   136 Dec  5 23:01 log
drwxr-xr-x  17 nsingh  staff   578 Dec  6 09:42 nimbleshop
drwxr-xr-x   8 nsingh  staff   272 Dec  5 23:03 public
drwxr-xr-x   3 nsingh  staff   102 Dec  5 23:00 script
drwxr-xr-x   6 nsingh  staff   204 Dec  5 23:05 tmp
drwxr-xr-x   4 nsingh  staff   136 Dec  5 23:00 vendor
</shell>

Notice that there is nimbleshop directory in between. That is where the nimbleshop code was copied from earlier step.

h4. Configuring app to use local nimbleshop theme.

Open the +Gemfile+ of your app and add +path+ option to gem +nimbleshop_simply+ .

<shell>
gem 'nimbleshop_simply', path: './nimbleshop/themes/nimbleshop_simply'
</shell>

h4. Customizing theme

Now open file +myshop/nimbleshop/themes/nimbleshop_simply/app/assets/stylesheets/nimbleshop_simply/custom.css.scss+ . Go to the bottom of the page and add following lines.

<shell>
body {
  background: green;
}
</shell>

h4. Start your rails server

Now start your rails server by running command +rails server+ and visit +http:localhost:3000+ . If you see green background then it means your customization is working .

h4. Customization is only for the theme

Even though you have the full nimbleShop folder in your +myshop+ rails application, any changes made to outside of +nimbleshop_simply+ will not be taken into account.
